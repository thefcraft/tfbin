# tfbin

`tfbin` is a file extension utility designed to simplify the handling of folders and files. It creates zip-like archives without compression, with support for encryption. It also offers tools to convert folders to `tfbin` files, extract `tfbin` files back to folders, and view the contents of `tfbin` files in a terminal-based TUI (Text User Interface). 

## Features

- **Convert Folder to tfbin**: Easily package a folder into a `tfbin` file.
- **Extract tfbin to Folder**: Unpack a `tfbin` file back into its original folder structure.
- **Terminal-based TUI**: View and manage `tfbin` file contents in a user-friendly terminal interface.
- **Single File Viewing**: Open and view individual files from a `tfbin` archive using a temporary file.

## NOTE

- **this is just a demo app to learn encryption and learn data structure and rust so it may contains some bugs**
